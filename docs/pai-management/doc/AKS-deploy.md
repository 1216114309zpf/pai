## OpenPAI deploy on AKS


### AKS K8S cluster cluster

AKS's k8s cluster has the following characteristics, affecting our targeted deployment configuration items.

- The default node operating system disk is small (Step 0 "Precautions" part is related to this item)
- The cluster node has only intranet IP by default. (Step 0 "Precautions" part is related to this item)
- Cluster's service pod access to K8S api-server requires authentication (Step 3 "Precautions" part is related to this item)
- K8s dashboard pod is not deployed on user-created nodes (Step 3 "Precautions" part is related to this item)
- api-server pod is not deployed on user-created nodes (Step 3 is "Precautions" part related to this item)

### Deployment Steps
- [Step 0. Prepare an AKS cluster](#c-step-0)
- [Step 1. Prepare Deployment Environment](#c-step-1)
- [Step 2. Prepare configuration](#c-step-2)
- [Step 3. Update cluster configuration into kubernetes](#c-step-4)
- [Step 4. Start all OpenPAI services](#c-step-5)
- [appendix. Validate deployment](#appendix)

***

### Step 0. Prepare an AKS cluster <a name="c-step-0"></a>

Users can refer to the AKS official documentation to [deploy an AKS cluster through the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough#create-aks-cluster).

***Precautions***:

- Use the ***az aks create*** command to create an AKS cluster. Configure the node os disk through the configuration item ***--node-osdisk-size to*** have large disk space. 

- Admin could open the OpenPAI homepage to the external network users through [Azure load balancer and service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/static-ip). Redirect public ip to port 80 (default is OpenPAI master node 80 port)

OpenPAI main page port config item at services-configuration.yaml:

```
cluster:
  pylon:
    port: 80
```

### Step 1. Prepare Deployment Environment <a name="c-step-1"></a>

Step 1.1 Prepare deployment related dependency.

- [Option A. Start Dev-box contianer as the environemnt.](./how-to-setup-dev-box.md) 
- [Option B. Install necessary dependency software on your host.](./how-to-install-depdencey.md)

Note 1: If you wanna manage the cluster in a machine belonging to OpenPAI, please choose option B. Otherwise, option A is highly recommended.

Step 1.2 [Prepare kubectl over your deployment environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough#connect-to-the-cluster).

***

### Step 2. Prepare Configuraiton <a name="c-step-2"></a>

- [Option A. Generate the Cluster Configuration from template](./how-to-generate-cluster-config.md)
- [Option B. Write your own Cluster Configuration](./customized-configuration.md)

If this the first time for you to deploy OpenPAI, Option A is highly recommended. 

If you wanna customize the configuration, you could firstly follow the Option A to generate a rough cluster configuration. And then you can follow Option B to customize your configuration according to your requirements.

If you are very familiar with OpenPAI, you could directly write your configuraiton based on the Option B.

***Precautions***:

- (1) api-server access ip & authentication configuration itemï¼š
  
config items at kubernetes-configuration.yaml:

```
layout:
  kubernetes:
    api-servers-url: http://10.1.0.6
    serviceaccount_token_path: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/
```

How to get:

```
kubectl cluster-info
```

- (2) K8S dashboard IP address:

config items at kubernetes-configuration.yaml:

```
layout:
  kubernetes:
    load-balance-ip: http://10.1.0.5
```

How to get:
```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep dashboard
```
output: kubernetes-dashboard-5c4896df4-wnvvm   1/1     Running   5          5d18h
```
kubectl describe pods kubernetes-dashboard-5c4896df4-wnvvm -n kube-system | grep IP
```
